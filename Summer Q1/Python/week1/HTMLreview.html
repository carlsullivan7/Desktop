        <p>Ive been listening to his usic since his album self titles so 2016. His music has served to infuential to alot of other rappers and his albums are enjoyable every time no matter the wait had for each last album at over a 4 year wait with almost no released forcing listeners to listen to unreleaded or leaked music.</p>
